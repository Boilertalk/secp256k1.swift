# :alembic: secp256k1

This library provides [secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) bindings for Swift with Cocoapods, Carthage and Swift Package Manager on macOS and Linux.    
The Cocoapods version supports iOS 8.0, macOS 10.10, tvOS 9.0 and watchOS 2.0. The Swift Package Manager version supports macOS and Linux.

We try to merge bug fix commits ASAP and only change the import and config structure of the original repository in order to create a compilable version for the package managers.

All credits for the original source code goes to [bitcoin-core](https://github.com/bitcoin-core).

> Note: This library only binds the original C code into a Swift package. If you want an Ethereum Web3 package which manages signatures and verifications, check out [Web3.swift](https://github.com/Boilertalk/Web3.swift)
